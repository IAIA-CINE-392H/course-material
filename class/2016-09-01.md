* Create a class for the data set using a header file.  
* Specify at least two member variables (album title, album artist, etc).  
* Specfiy one member function that prints all of the data from the class (use the cout command).  
* Define the function body in an associated cpp file.  
* In the main.cpp file create at least two objects of your class and assign the associated data to the member variables.  
* In the main.cpp create a keyboard-based menu system that allows users to print each object's data by typing a specific word.
