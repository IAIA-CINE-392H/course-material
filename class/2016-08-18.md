##Notes

###Command Prompt
This is the text-based interaface for the Windows operating system. This is derived from "DOS", but is now known as the "Command Prompt".  

To enter the Command Prompt:  
1. Press the Windows command key   
2. Type "cmd", then hit "Enter"  

To use this interface face we enter text commands followed by a space then options to those commands.  

These are the commands that we convered in class:  

**dir** - list content of the current directory (aka: folder)  
**mkdir [name]** - create a directory with specific name  
**cd [name]** - change directory, you can also press "tab" to cycle through all files in the directory  
**cd ..** - move to parent directory

Here is more complete list of commands:

In Windows an program is known as an executable. It has the file extension **exe**.  
To run an executable in the command prompt, simply type the name of the program.  

###Visual Studio (Windows)

Here is a video tutorial that basically does what we did:

If your computer at home is a Macintosh, then you'll use Xcode for homework.  
First, you'll need to download Xcode on the App Store.  
Then, try the hello work tutorial outlined here:
